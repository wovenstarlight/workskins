# wovenstarlight's AO3 work skins
This is a collection of my Archive Of Our Own work skins, along with samples. You can find me on AO3 directly: here are [my work skin previews](https://archiveofourown.org/users/wovenstarlight/pseuds/unpredictableArtist), and [my writing/fics](https://archiveofourown.org/users/wovenstarlight/pseuds/wovenstarlight).

## Files
For each work skin, this repo has:
- 1 CSS file: the actual code for the workskin. What gets saved as a workskin on AO3.
- 1 HTML file: a preview for the workskin. If I've posted an AO3 preview, this contains the code for that page. At the top of each HTML file will be a link to the AO3 preview of the skin.

Feel free to use these skins as you'd like. If *adding on to or otherwise modifying* these skins, **you must credit [@wovenstarlight](https://archiveofourown.org/users/wovenstarlight) on AO3**.
